# Electron
Cross-Platform Extensible CPU Video Editor

## Building
Electron uses it's own build system to make development faster and smoother.
HashBuild is maybe the most minimalistic build system ever that can provide straightforward way to build your project

Building steps:
* (Optional) Run `python HashBuild/hash_build.py -dclean`
* Run `python HashBuild/hash_build.py` to build

After some time Electron executable will appear in root folder with required dll files

Read `HashBuild/README.md` to get more info about HashBuild
