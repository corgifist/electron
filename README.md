# Electron
Cross-Platform Extensible CPU Video Editor

## Building
Electron uses it's own build system to make development faster and smoother.
HashBuild is the maybe the most minimalistic build system ever that can provide straightforward way to build your project

Building steps:
* Extract `HashBuild/` folder's content to Electron root folder
* (Optional) Run `python hash_build.py -dclean`
* Run `python hash_build.py` to build

After some time Electron executable will appear in root folder with required dll files

Read `HashBuild/README.md` to get more info about HashBuild
